# Linux Filesystems

This is an incomplete book on Linux filesystems from a kernel perspective. I found that it was just too much work to try and understand some parts of the kernel so I have given up for now. For example, I spent way too many weeks on pathname resolution and still don't understand parts of it.

I also didn't want to go through the publishing phase again. I'd make no money going through traditional publishers and really don't want to do it myself.

Therefore, I am making on-line courses out of some of the material. You will find those on udemy.com starting April 2024.

My hope is that people will help contribute. Don't worry about formatting. I can take care of that.

I hope this is useful to people.
