1. Make sure you can ssh/scp without stopping for a password on the target:

    On the client run:

        $ ssh-keygen

    and press enter / say "y" in response to questions

        $ cd ~/.ssh
        $ ssh-copy-id spate@192.168.64.11 <--- target

    type the password of your user on the target when prompted

    Check that it works by ssh spate@192.168.64.11

2. Make sure you can sudo without a password by adding the following line
   to /etc/sudoers:

        spate ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
